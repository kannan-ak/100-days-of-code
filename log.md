# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 19 August 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a python script to print the location of the given bucket

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time in configuring git to use personal github account. Finally managed to fix it at 12.15 AM and commited using my personal github account.

### Day 1: 20 August 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a python script using boto3 to print the location, logging status, versioning status of all S3 buckets in your account.

**Thoughts:** I wrote this at night 11 PM. I never stayed late before just to write a python script. This time I'm commited myself to 100daysofcode so doing it. 

I felt this script is fairly easy as I know what method to select to get the logging, versioning details. I should increase the difficult level everyday.
